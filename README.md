## Overview

I began web development in 2021 out of a passion for providing accessibility to the web. I realized after learning basic HTML/CSS/JS, I lacked a tangible portfolio for those interested to see. This repository begins my journey to pursuing web development full time.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
- Navigate the user interface in a linear, accessible way.
-

## My process

1.) Determine timeframe (1 week)
2.) Planning phase/Mobile Interface Wireframe (Day 1)
3.) Mobile Development/Debug (Day 2 - 3)
4.) Web Interface Wireframe (Days 4 - 5)
5.) Web Interface Development/Debug (Day 6)
6.) Final Debugging/Submission (Day 7)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the uses of declaring variables up front; such as color palettes. This significantly improved my workflow. I also learned how to control the look and feel of interactions like button hovers and clicking on links using the hover

```css
/* Color Palette Declaration */
:root {
    /* Primary Colors */
    --paleblue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
    --brightblue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);

    /* Neutral Colors */
    --verypaleblue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    --desaturatedblue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
    --darkblue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
}

/* Button Design */
button.payment-button {
    background-color: var(--brightblue);
    border-radius: 10px;
    border-style: none;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 16px;
    padding: 15px 15px;
    width: 100%;
    color: white;
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 10px 0px rgba(68, 102, 187, 0.35);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to become more familiar with mobile-first web design. I have only been taught to create sites using the screen sizes of most computer screens. Howver, I am still trying to learn responsive web design. Notice JS was not included also. I am seeking to branch into JS in future projects.
