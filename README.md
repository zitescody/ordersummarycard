## Overview

I began web development in 2021 out of a passion for providing accessibility to the web. I realized after learning basic HTML/CSS/JS, I lacked a tangible portfolio for those interested to see. This repository begins my journey to pursuing web development full time.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
- Navigate the user interface in a linear, accessible way.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

1.) Determine timeframe (1 week)
2.) Planning phase/Mobile Interface Wireframe (Day 1)
3.) Mobile Development/Debug (Day 2 - 3)
4.) Web Interface Wireframe (Days 4 - 5)
5.) Web Interface Development/Debug (Day 6)
6.) Final Debugging/Submission (Day 7)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the uses of declaring variables up front; such as color palettes. This significantly improved my workflow. I also learned how to control the look and feel of interactions like button hovers and clicking on links using the hover

```css
/* Color Palette Declaration */
:root {
    /* Primary Colors */
    --paleblue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
    --brightblue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);

    /* Neutral Colors */
    --verypaleblue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    --desaturatedblue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
    --darkblue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
}

/* Button Design */
button.payment-button {
    background-color: var(--brightblue);
    border-radius: 10px;
    border-style: none;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 16px;
    padding: 15px 15px;
    width: 100%;
    color: white;
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 10px 0px rgba(68, 102, 187, 0.35);
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
